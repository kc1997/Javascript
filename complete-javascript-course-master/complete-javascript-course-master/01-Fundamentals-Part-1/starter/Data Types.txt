1. Number: Floating point numbers -> Used for decimal and integers 
e.g: let age = 23;

2. String: Sequence of characters -> Used for text.
e.g: let firstName = 'Kunal';


3. Boolean: Logical types that can be true or false -> Used for taking decisions
e.g: let fullAge = true;

4. Undefined: Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('empty value')
e.g: let children;

5. Null: Also means 'empty value'

6. Symbol (ES2015): Value that is unique and cannot be changed.

JavaScript has dynamic typing: We do not have to manually define the data type of the
value stored in a variable. Instead, data types are determined automatically.
